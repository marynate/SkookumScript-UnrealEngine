// Description Decrements the number of expressions / tasks currently executing in
//             parallel that the invoked object is waiting for a return value from.
//             If the number was greater than 0 (so the invoked object was suspended) and
//             the pending number is reduced back to 0 then the invoked object will
//             resume.
// Arg         success - if the pending task was successful/completed then this should be
//             set to true.  If the pending task was unsuccessful/incomplete/aborted then
//             this can be set to false and the entire call stack leading up to this
//             invoked object will be aborted and unwound.
//             [*** Setting this to false should only be used in dire situations and
//             could have all sorts of unanticipated knock-on effects with nearby
//             dependant code being aborted.]
