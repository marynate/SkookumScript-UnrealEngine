// The generic/reflective class `ThisClass_` refers to the class type of the current
// class scope that uses it in its members.  It is never actually used directly as a
// class - only as an alias to another class type and as such does not have any members
// in its native directory.
//
// Its name has a trailing underscore `_` to indicate that it is generic/reflective and
// to set it apart from other classes.
