//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The generic/reflective class `ItemClass_` refers to the class type of the items/
// elements of the class scope that uses it in its members - such as items in the List
// class.  It is never actually used directly as a class - only as an alias to another
// class type and as such does not have any members in its native directory.
//
// Its name has a trailing underscore `_` to indicate that it is generic/reflective and
// to set it apart from other classes.
