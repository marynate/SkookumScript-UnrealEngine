This is the SkookumScript library.

It is used in both a Game Engine and in SkookumScript Tools such as the SkookumScript IDE.
It is for the most part platform independant.


=========================================================================================
Library Dependencies
=========================================================================================

  AgogCore.lib (C Runtime (CRT) [Multi-threaded DLL])


=========================================================================================
Preprocessor defines
=========================================================================================

Defines:
 
  See "Build Targets" below.

  Each of the libraries that this library is depandant on should have their doc files
  examined to note any defines or other useful info.


  SKOOKUM = # [See below]

  These are the possible flags that may be set for the SKOOKUM define:
    1  - [SK_DEBUG]     Include extra SkookumScript debugging code.
    2  - [SK_CODE_IN]   Include ability to parse SkookumScript string code into internal data strucutres.
    4  - [SK_CODE_OUT]  Include ability to generate SkookumScript string code from internal data structures.
    8  - [SK_COMPILED_IN]  Include ability to read in SkookumScript compiled binary code and convert it to internal data structures.
    16 - [SK_COMPILED_OUT] Include ability to generate SkookumScript compiled binary code from internal data structures.

  The SS_* flags are defined in SkookumScript.hpp

  Here are some common configuration values for the SKOOKUM define:

    SkookumScript IDE - and tools that need to generate compiled binary code

      SKOOKUM = 31  [SK_DEBUG | SK_CODE_IN | SK_CODE_OUT | SK_COMPILED_IN | SK_COMPILED_OUT]

    Game - and other tools that do not to generate compiled binary code

      SKOOKUM = 15  [SK_DEBUG | SK_CODE_IN | SK_CODE_OUT | SK_COMPILED_IN]

    Game (Release / Final) - provided game doesn't allow new code on the fly and the compiled binary code is well debugged

      SKOOKUM = 8   [SK_COMPILED_IN]


Platform Specific Defines:

  Windows specific: _WIN32, _LIB

  - Build Properties:
     'Checked'   - Extra checking is performed and tool/editor hook ins are present
     'Optimized' - Fully optimized compile and code is inlined (faster, but harder to debug)
  - Executables with different build types are appended with -TargetName to tell them apart.
  - Debug info is included in all builds.  The binaries (exe, lib, and obj files) have no
    extra info stored in them - all debug info is stored in separate .pdb files.  [The only
    difference of a binary compiled without debug info is that a path to the .pdb file is
    stored in the binary, though the binary will still work just fine without the .pdb file
    present.]
